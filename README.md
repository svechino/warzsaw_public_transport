# Warsaw Public Transport Analysis 🚋🚌🚇
## 📍 Overview
This project analyzes public transport activity in Warsaw, focusing on passenger flow, stop utilization, and route density. The goal is to visualize transit patterns, helping to identify the busiest stops and understand transport efficiency across the city.

The Dashboard Tableau available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alexandra.meshi/viz/WarszawPublicTransport/DashbordMapHours)

## 📊 Project Purpose
We developed this dashboard to:
✔️ Estimate passenger flow across public transport stops.
✔️ Identify high-traffic areas and potential overcrowding points.
✔️ Compare different transport types (bus, tram, metro, rail) based on their usage patterns.
✔️ Provide insights into route connectivity and transport network efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Features

Passenger Flow Estimation → Approximate calculation of passengers per stop.
Stop Usage Visualization → Color-coded and size-scaled markers on an interactive map.
Metro Frequency Integration → Special handling of metro routes using frequency-based schedules.
Top 20 Busiest Stops → A dynamic ranking that updates based on the selected time filters.
